### Rust
Because it's made in rust.

### Krusty
Because it's made by a dumb clown.

Because it just had to have the "ify" suffix, as in "notify".

## How to contribute and help the project
I don't know, I never thought I'd get this far. Also since I'm just learning about how to code in rust it's probably full of bad practices and awful code. :)
